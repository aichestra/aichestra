# Aichestra: Building an Intelligent Agent Routing System with A2A Protocol and LangGraph

## Background

In today's rapidly evolving AI landscape, organizations are increasingly adopting specialized AI agents to handle specific tasks - from currency conversions to mathematical calculations to Kubernetes operations. However, managing multiple agents and routing user requests to the right agent presents significant challenges. How do you ensure that a currency conversion request reaches the currency agent, while a mathematical equation gets routed to the math agent?

**Aichestra** solves this problem by providing an intelligent orchestration system that automatically routes user requests to the most appropriate specialized agent using dynamic capability discovery, skill-based matching, and confidence scoring.

## Project Overview

Aichestra is an intelligent multi-agent routing system built with modern technologies:

- **ü§ñ Smart Orchestrator**: Central routing engine using LangGraph workflows
- **üîß Orchestrator Client**: Command-line interface for seamless interactions
- **üîó A2A Protocol**: Standardized agent communication protocol
- **üí∞ Sample Agent: Currency Agent**: Specialized for financial operations and exchange rates
- **üßÆ Sample Agent: Math Agent**: Advanced mathematical calculations and equation solving
- **‚ò∏Ô∏è Sample Agent: ArgoCD Agent**: Kubernetes and GitOps operations management

## Architecture

The Aichestra system follows a hub-and-spoke architecture with the Smart Orchestrator at its center:

```

### Smart Orchestrator
The orchestrator serves as the intelligent routing engine:

- **A2A Card Resolver**: Fetches agent capabilities from running endpoints
- **Dynamic Skill Registry**: Extracts skills, tags, and keywords from AgentCards
- **Confidence Scoring**: Quantifies routing decisions (0.0-1.0 scale)
- **LangGraph Workflow**: Simple analyze ‚Üí route decision process
- **Agent Communication**: HTTP-based communication with selected agents
- **Agent Management**: Register and unregister agents

### A2A Protocol Integration
The system uses the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) protocol for standardized communication:

```python
# Agent Card structure
AgentCard(
    name="Currency Agent",
    description="Handles currency exchange and financial data",
    url="http://localhost:8002/",
    skills=[
        AgentSkill(
            name="currency_exchange",
            tags=["currency", "exchange", "usd", "eur", "inr"],
            description="Currency exchange operations and rate lookups"
        )
    ]
)
```

### MCP Integration

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) provides a standardized way for agents to access external tools and resources. Aichestra supports both **custom MCP servers** that we build ourselves and **existing MCP servers** from the community:

**Custom MCP Server Development**
We can build specialized MCP servers tailored to our specific needs:

**Math Agent MCP Integration**
```python
# Math MCP Server with mathematical tools
from mcp import McpServer
from mcp.types import Tool, TextContent

class MathMCPServer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.server = McpServer("math-mcp-server")
        self.register_tools()
    
    def register_tools(self):
        @self.server.tool("calculate")
        async def calculate(expression: str) -> str:
            """Evaluate mathematical expressions safely"""
            # Safe mathematical evaluation
            return str(eval_math_expression(expression))
        
        @self.server.tool("solve_equation")
        async def solve_equation(equation: str) -> str:
            """Solve algebraic equations"""
            # Symbolic math solving
            return solve_symbolic_equation(equation)
```

**Existing MCP Server Integration**
We can also leverage existing MCP servers from the community:

**ArgoCD Agent MCP Integration with Akuity's ArgoCD MCP Server**
```python
# Using Akuity's ArgoCD MCP Server: https://github.com/akuity/argocd-mcp
class ArgocdAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize ArgoCD MCP server in stdio mode
        self.mcp_toolkit = self._setup_argocd_mcp()
        self.model = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model='gemini-2.0-flash')
        
        # Get MCP tools from ArgoCD server
        mcp_tools = self.mcp_toolkit.get_tools()
        
        # Create LangGraph agent with ArgoCD MCP tools
        self.graph = create_react_agent(
            model=self.model,
            tools=mcp_tools,
            checkpointer=MemorySaver()
        )
    
    def _setup_argocd_mcp(self):
        """Setup ArgoCD MCP server using Akuity's implementation"""
        # Environment variables for ArgoCD connection
        argocd_base_url = os.getenv("ARGOCD_BASE_URL", "https://localhost:8080")
        argocd_api_token = os.getenv("ARGOCD_API_TOKEN")
        
        if not argocd_api_token:
            raise ValueError("ARGOCD_API_TOKEN environment variable is required")
        
        # Initialize MCPToolkit with ArgoCD MCP server
        return MCPToolkit(
            server_command=["npx", "argocd-mcp@latest", "stdio"],
            server_env={
                "ARGOCD_BASE_URL": argocd_base_url,
                "ARGOCD_API_TOKEN": argocd_api_token,
                # For self-signed certificates (development only)
                "NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED": "0"  # Use with caution
            },
            transport="stdio"
        )
```

**Benefits of MCP Integration**
1. **Standardized Tool Access**: Consistent interface for external tools
2. **Community Ecosystem**: Leverage existing MCP servers like Akuity's ArgoCD server
3. **Custom Extensions**: Build specialized tools for specific domains
4. **Secure Isolation**: Tools run in separate processes for security
5. **Easy Integration**: Simple protocol for adding new capabilities
6. **Production Ready**: Use battle-tested servers like the Akuity ArgoCD MCP server

### LangGraph Integration

LangGraph provides the workflow orchestration engine for both the Smart Orchestrator and individual agents:

**Smart Orchestrator LangGraph Workflow**
```python

class SmartOrchestrator:
    def _create_workflow(self):
        """Create the orchestrator's LangGraph workflow"""
        workflow = StateGraph(RouterState)
        
        # Define workflow nodes
        workflow.add_node("analyze", self._analyze_request)
        workflow.add_node("route", self._route_to_agent)
        
        # Define workflow edges
        workflow.add_edge("analyze", "route")
        workflow.set_entry_point("analyze")
        workflow.set_finish_point("route")
        
        return workflow.compile()
```

**Currency Agent LangGraph ReAct Pattern**
```python
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver

class CurrencyAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize LLM and tools
        self.model = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model='gemini-2.0-flash')
        self.tools = [get_exchange_rate]
        self.memory = MemorySaver()
        
        # Create ReAct agent with LangGraph
        self.graph = create_react_agent(
            model=self.model,
            tools=self.tools,
            checkpointer=self.memory,
            prompt=self.SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION,
            response_format=ResponseFormat
        )
```

**Math Agent LangGraph with MCP Tools**
```python
from langchain_mcp_adapters import MCPToolkit

class MathAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize MCP connection
        self.mcp_toolkit = MCPToolkit(
            server_path="./math_mcp_server.py",
            transport="stdio"
        )
        
        # Get MCP tools
        mcp_tools = self.mcp_toolkit.get_tools()
        
        # Create LangGraph agent with MCP tools
        self.model = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model='gemini-2.0-flash')
        self.graph = create_react_agent(
            model=self.model,
            tools=mcp_tools,
            checkpointer=MemorySaver()
        )
```

    GoogleAI->>LangGraphEngine: "10 USD equals 832.50 INR<br/>Current exchange rate: 1 USD = 83.25 INR"
    
    LangGraphEngine->>CurrencyAgent: Final structured response<br/>{"status": "completed", "message": "..."}
    
    Note over CurrencyAgent: A2A Response Formatting
    CurrencyAgent->>SmartOrchestrator: A2A JSON-RPC Response<br/>{"result": {"status": "completed", "response": "..."}}
    
    Note over SmartOrchestrator: Response Processing & Metadata
    SmartOrchestrator->>SmartOrchestrator: Add routing metadata:<br/>- Selected agent: Currency Agent<br/>- Confidence: 0.90<br/>- Processing time: 1.2s
    
    SmartOrchestrator->>OrchestratorClient: Complete Response<br/>üéØ Routed to Currency Agent ‚Üí 10 USD equals 832.50 INR
    
    OrchestratorClient->>User: "üéØ Routed to Currency Agent ‚Üí 10 USD equals 832.50 INR<br/>Current exchange rate: 1 USD = 83.25 INR<br/>Confidence: 90% | Processing time: 1.2s"
```

Key Steps in the Flow are as following:

1. **User Input**: User submits "What is 10 USD to INR?" through the orchestrator client
2. **A2A Protocol**: Client wraps the request in A2A JSON-RPC format and sends to orchestrator
3. **Request Analysis**: SmartOrchestrator extracts the request content and begins LangGraph workflow
4. **Skill Matching**: System calculates scores for each agent based on keywords and skills:
   - Currency Agent: 4.5/5.0 (matches "USD", "INR", currency context)
   - Math Agent: 0.0/5.0 (no mathematical operations detected)
   - ArgoCD Agent: 0.0/5.0 (no Kubernetes context)
5. **Confidence Scoring**: Converts raw score to confidence percentage (90% for Currency Agent)
6. **Agent Routing**: Forwards request to Currency Agent via A2A protocol
7. **LangGraph Processing**: Currency Agent uses ReAct pattern to understand and process request
8. **Tool Execution**: Agent calls `get_exchange_rate` tool to fetch live data from Frankfurter API
9. **Response Generation**: Agent calculates result and formats user-friendly response
10. **Response Routing**: Result flows back through orchestrator to client with routing information

## How the Orchestrator Works

### Agent Discovery and Registration

The orchestrator maintains a dynamic registry of available agents:

1. **Initialization**: Connects to default endpoints (8001, 8002, 8003)
2. **Card Fetching**: Uses A2A CardResolver to retrieve agent metadata
3. **Skill Extraction**: Builds searchable keyword registry from agent skills
4. **Dynamic Updates**: Supports runtime agent registration/unregistration

### Request Processing Pipeline

```python
async def process_request(self, request: str) -> Dict:
    # 1. Initialize LangGraph state
    initial_state = RouterState(request=request, ...)
    
    # 2. Execute workflow: analyze ‚Üí route
    final_state = await self.workflow.ainvoke(initial_state)
    
    # 3. Return routing decision with metadata
    return {
        "selected_agent_name": agent_card.name,
        "confidence": final_state["confidence"],
        "reasoning": final_state["reasoning"],
        "response": final_state["response"]
    }
```

### Confidence Scoring Algorithm

The system uses a multi-factor scoring approach:

1. **Primary Matching** (Weight: 1.5)
   - Direct skill name matches
   - Skill description keyword matches

2. **Secondary Matching** (Weight: 1.0)
   - Agent skill tag matches
   - Agent name keyword matches

3. **Confidence Calculation**
   ```python
   confidence = min(best_score / 5.0, 1.0)  # Normalize to 0.0-1.0
   ```

4. **Fallback Strategy**
   - Default to ArgoCD agent if no clear winner
   - Minimum confidence threshold for routing decisions

## Agent Interaction Examples

## Future Improvements

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

The current system focuses on single-agent routing, but future enhancements will support **multi-agent workflows**:

**Collaborative Task Execution**
```python
# Future: Multi-agent workflow for complex requests
request = "Calculate the total cost of deploying 5 replicas of an application that costs $10 USD per month, converted to EUR"

# Workflow would involve:
# 1. Math Agent: Calculate 5 √ó $10 = $50 USD
# 2. Currency Agent: Convert $50 USD to EUR  
# 3. ArgoCD Agent: Validate deployment configuration
# 4. Orchestrator: Combine results into final response
```

**Agent Coordination Patterns**
- **Sequential Workflows**: Agent A ‚Üí Agent B ‚Üí Agent C
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents working simultaneously
- **Conditional Branching**: Route based on intermediate results
- **Error Recovery**: Fallback agents for failed operations

### Data Persistence and Recovery

**Conversation History**
```python
# Persistent conversation storage
class ConversationStore:
    async def save_conversation(self, context_id: str, messages: List[Message])
    async def retrieve_conversation(self, context_id: str) -> List[Message]
    async def search_conversations(self, query: str) -> List[ConversationSummary]
```

**Agent State Management**
- Persistent agent configurations and customizations
- Historical routing decisions for learning and optimization
- Agent performance metrics and success rates
- User preference learning for improved routing

**Recovery Mechanisms**
```python
# Future: Automatic recovery from agent failures
class RecoveryManager:
    async def handle_agent_failure(self, agent_id: str, request: str):
        # 1. Mark agent as temporarily unavailable
        # 2. Re-route to next best agent
        # 3. Log failure for analysis
        # 4. Attempt agent health recovery
```

### Advanced Routing Intelligence

**Machine Learning Integration**
- Learn from routing success/failure patterns
- User feedback integration for routing optimization
- Predictive routing based on request patterns
- Dynamic confidence threshold adjustment

**Context-Aware Routing**
```python
# Future: Context-aware agent selection
class ContextualRouter:
    def analyze_context(self, request: str, user_history: List[str], current_session: Session):
        # Consider user expertise level
        # Account for previous interactions
        # Adapt to user preferences
        # Optimize for session continuity
```

**Agent Load Balancing**
- Monitor agent response times and availability
- Distribute load across multiple instances of same agent type
- Implement circuit breaker patterns for failing agents
- Dynamic scaling based on demand

### Enhanced Monitoring and Analytics

**Real-time Dashboards**
- Agent performance metrics and health status
- Request routing patterns and success rates
- User interaction analytics and satisfaction scores
- System resource utilization and bottlenecks

**Observability Integration**
```python
# Future: Comprehensive observability
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram
from opentelemetry import trace

routing_counter = Counter('agent_routing_total', 'Total agent routing requests')
response_time = Histogram('agent_response_seconds', 'Agent response time')
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)
```
